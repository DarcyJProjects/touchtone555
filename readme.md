# TouchTone555 ‚Äì NE555 Analogue Stylus Synth

The **TouchTone555** is a fully analogue, NE555-based synthesizer designed for learning about analogue electronics, and a bit of fun too. It was built from scratch as a personal deep-dive into oscillators, signal integrity, analogue filtering, and amplification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarcyJProjects/touchtone555/main/media/4.png)

### üßæ What You‚Äôll Need

- All components as outlined in the [BOM (Bill-of-Materials)](https://github.com/DarcyJProjects/touchtone555/blob/main/hardware/Bill%20of%20Materials.csv)
- To find the correct switches, speaker, audio jack, etc, see [Miscellaneous Parts](https://github.com/DarcyJProjects/touchtone555/blob/main/hardware/misc_parts.md)
- PCB (See [KiCad Project](https://github.com/DarcyJProjects/touchtone555/tree/main/hardware))
- Soldering iron and solder
- 9V Battery and connector or DC jack with 9V supply

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** I recommend selecting a **lead-free surface finish** (e.g., LeadFree HASL) when ordering the PCB as the stylus will put microscopic scratches in the exposed key pads during use. This could potentially produce harmful lead dust over time. Therefore, I highly recommend choosing lead-free!

### ü™õ Assembly

- Read each step fully before completing it to make sure you've read any handy tips :)
1. **Order the PCB**
   The KiCad project files (and pre-exported gerber files) are located in [/hardware](https://github.com/DarcyJProjects/touchtone555/tree/main/hardware).

2. **Solder components in order**
   Start with the smallest passive components (resistors, monolithic capacitors, diodes), then IC sockets, transistors, connectors/jacks/switches, ceramic and polyester capacitors, and finally the DC jack, trim potentiometers and the volume potentiometer.
   
   Soldering them systematically from smallest height to largest makes it a lot easier! Follow the component designators on the board, and in the BOM to make sure you are matching the correct values and components.
   
   Try your best not to get any solder on the exposed key pads, if you're nervous, you  can tape over them with some electrical or painters tape until you're finished soldering.
   
   For the polyester octave capacitors, try to get the values matched to each other as closely as possible as a small variance of 0.5 nF can throw off the pitch. This is less important for the lower octaves, but the highest octave with the single capacitor matters the most.
   
   For the vibrato monolithic capacitors, you can start with soldering the top three in, and adding the lower two if you want increase the vibrato frequency.

3. **Attach speaker & power**
   The synth is designed to run on 9VDC, so I recommend using a 9V battery with a 9V battery to JST connector.

4. **Tune keys**
   Use a tuner app (with a chromatic mode) or oscilloscope to set the individual key pitches via the blue trim potentiometers.
   
   Set the octave to the lowest octave (lowest position on the octave switch) and then start tuning with the highest note on the keyboard, which corresponds to the right-most trim pot. Turning it clockwise will increase the pitch, and anticlockwise will decrease the pitch. You are aiming for the highest note (in the lowest octave) to be E6.
   
   Then work your way leftwards, one potentiometer at a time, reducing the pitch by one semitone each time.
   
   Remember, as this is a series resistor network, adjusting the pitch of one potentiometer will adjust the pitch of all the other keys to the left of that key. This is why you should work right to left.

5. **Vibrato depth**
   
   By turning the vibrato depth trim pot, you can slightly adjust how strong the vibrato effect is. The change with each turn is minimal, so you'll need to turn it a lot to get any real difference. 

6. **Have fun!**

## üß† Why I Built This

This was a personal challenge to push my understanding of analogue electronics beyond textbooks ‚Äî especially in:

- Oscillator design
- Filtering
- Operational amplifiers
- Audio amplifiers
- Impedance buffering
- PCB design with custom exposed planes (the key pads)
- PCB footprint design
